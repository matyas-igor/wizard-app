## Limitations

- Not optimized for mobile devices
- Tested only in Chrome on desktops
- No backend API connected
- No pagination used

## Notes

- For form state management `formik` is used although it can be replaced with simple state
  - Also `formik` can be moved up to the more general scope level
- Some animation added by using `react-spring`
